<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>I am a computer science professional and volunteer at a local Code Club. This blog documents my experience in sharing my passion for computer science and problem solving through programming. I write articles with computer science educators and other volunteers in mind, sharing my lessons learnt and philosophy on learning computer science along the way.</p>

<p>See my <a href="/articles/16/hello-world">Hello, World!</a> post for more about the Code Club initiative, or continue below to read about my journey into computer science.</p>

<h3 id="my-journey-into-compsci">My Journey into CompSci</h3>

<p>I started to learn to write computer programs when I was 8 as I was lucky enough to have an older brother to spur me on and a father working in IT who provided us with a computer with which we could experiment. He didn’t teach us any coding himself, rather he chucked a book at us (<em>Sams Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 Hours</em> <label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Whilst this was a good book back then, Visual Basic 6 is a very old language now so I would not recommend it. </span>) and left us to it. There’s a lot of value in learning computer science by curiosity-driven experimentation - just trying things and seeing what happens. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to make my own computer games (and the rest of it playing real computer games), the first of which was a rudimentary version of <em>Family Fortunes</em> and the rest of which were generally <em>Star Trek</em> themed in some way<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Yes, that’s right, I’m a geek and proud! </span>. I discovered the <a href="http://www.truevision3d.com/">TrueVision3D</a> library which made it a lot easier for me to include 3D graphics in my games and taught me an important lesson: never re-invent the wheel! Whilst plagiarism is bad, it’s perfectly acceptable practice to use bits of code other people have already written to make your life easier.<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Always check the software license included by the author(s) specifying how you are permitted to use to their code. </span></p>

<p>After a while, I got bored of writing Visual Basic code and never really clicked with Microsoft’s .NET framework, so I decided to go hardcore and start learning <em>C++</em>. Languages like C its big brother C++ are described as <em>low level</em> meaning the code you write is pretty close to the actual machine instructions which are executed on the hardware. Writing in a low level language gives you a lot of power and potential for better performance but at the cost of a steeper learning curve, slower development time and greater potential for bugs. Learning to write C++ was a valuable experience as it gave me a greater appreciation for how computers actually work, but I quickly grew frustrated with obtuse <em>Segmentation Fault</em> error messages.</p>

<p>Then followed an exploration of the world of website programming through learning HTML, ASP and PHP<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Think of ASP as Visual Basic for websites, and PHP as C++ for websites. </span> before discovering Java. Java, and Microsoft’s competitor C#, are two successors to C++ and are both high level languages. Java code gets executed within a Java <em>Virtual Machine</em> rather than on the hardware directly. Java allowed me to write code a lot quicker, which was great for what I wanted to be able to do: experiment with lots of different algorithms and not care too much about efficiency nor what was going on under the hood. I did not stop here, though! I then stumbled across Python, which I found even better for quickly prototyping up ideas for ways of solving problems. I have grown quite fond of Python over the years, and it has become one of the goto languages for newcomers to the world of programming due to its simplicity. Sure, it’s not as powerful and efficient as writing C code but unless you are writing your own operating system or high performance scientific code this is usually not important.</p>

<p>This began a life time of passion for computer science. Programming is about logic, yes, but to me it is also about creativity. I have never been able to paint nor draw, but I imagine that an artist receives a similar sort of satisfaction staring at their completed canvas as I do when my program finally executes without error. It’s that blending of creativity and logic that makes it exciting.</p>
