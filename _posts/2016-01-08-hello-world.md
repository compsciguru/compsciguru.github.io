{%newthought "Computer science has been an integral part of my life from a young age" %} and I obtain a great deal of pleasure from passing on my passion for technology to the next generation. I am also keen to use this blog to share my thoughts on the best ways to engage children from all backgrounds with computer science and contribute teaching resources where possible, as a computer science professional (but not an educator). This first post{%sidenote 1 "It is traditional that the first computer program that you write displays the text 'Hello, World!' and is named as such."%} introduces the Code Club initiative with which I have recently become involved and expresses why I find computer science so exciting.

## Code Club
[Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) is a _nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11_. This UK not-for-profit organisation is part of the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/) and run by Clare Sutcliffe MBE{% sidenote 2 "Clare Sutcliffe was recently appointed as a member of the [Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire) in the 2016 New Year's Honours List for services to technology education." %}, co-founder and CEO. Together, Code Club and the Raspberry Pi Foundation aim to put a code club in every community across the world inspiring children to develop their computational thinking, problem solving, planning, designing and collaboration skills through technology.

Watch the video below to hear a panel of children interview potential Code Club volunteers, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee and HRH The Duke of York{% sidenote 3 "_'Urm, we were hoping for Prince Harry to be honest with you, Mr Winsor.'_"%}.

Code Club offers [online training](https://training.codeclub.org.uk) for volunteers which I have found very useful for knowing what to expect and making sure I have the prerequisite knowledge to add value to my local code club. 

## My Journey

The first two Code Club projects teach [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - the programming equivalent of Lego. Scratch provides a brilliant introduction to coding, but sadly did not exist back when I first started teaching myself programming aged 8. My first introduction into the wonderful world of ones and zeros came courtesy of _SAMS Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 Hours_. It tooks me quite a bit longer than 24 hours and most of my programs were full of bugs, though admittedly that was mainly due to my inconsistent and questionable spelling! I got there, though, pursuing a passion to bring to life computer games of my own imagining{% sidenote 4 "These were mainly themed around _Star Trek_ - I was a hardcore geek (and proud) from a young age." %}. You can read more about my experiences learning to code on the [About](/about) page.

## My Passion
I grew up very privileged and was allowed a computer to play with at a very young age. Knowing that my father wouldn't get upset if I did someone wrong and broke the computer fostered a curiosity about technology which quickly grew into confidence and passion.

I can remember trying to fix my class's computer at school when I was about 7 years old and getting frustrated at an error message that made so little sense to me it appeared to be written in a different language. So I decided that I should learn computer programming to remedy this.

It was a while before I realised that computer science is a lot more than just programming (no amount of understanding Visual Basic code would have helped me decipher that error message), but by then I had the bug for programming{% sidenote 5 "Along with a plague of computer 'bugs' festering in my code!" %}.

Programming is about logic, yes, but to me it is also about creativity. I have never been able to paint nor draw, but I imagine that an artist receives a similar sort of satisfaction staring at their completed canvas as I do when my program finally executes without error. Itâ€™s that blending of creativity and logic that makes it exciting.
