      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p class="subtitle">January 8, 2016</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Computer science has been an integral part of my life from a young age</span>  and I obtain a great deal of pleasure from passing on my passion for technology to the next generation. I am also keen to use this blog to share my thoughts on the best ways to engage children from all backgrounds with computer science and contribute teaching resources where possible, as a computer science professional (but not an educator). This first post<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">It is traditional that the first computer program that you write displays the text ‘Hello, World!’ and is named as such. </span> introduces the Code Club initiative with which I have recently become involved and expresses why I find computer science so exciting.</p>

<h2 id="code-club">Code Club</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/">Code Club</a> is a <em>nationwide network of volunteer-led after school coding clubs for children aged 9-11</em>. This UK not-for-profit organisation is part of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> and run by Clare Sutcliffe MBE<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Clare Sutcliffe was recently appointed as a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> in the 2016 New Year’s Honours List for services to technology education. </span>, co-founder and CEO. Together, Code Club and the Raspberry Pi Foundation aim to put a code club in every community across the world inspiring children to develop their computational thinking, problem solving, planning, designing and collaboration skills through technology.</p>

<p>Watch the video below to hear a panel of children interview potential Code Club volunteers, including Sir Tim Berners-Lee and HRH The Duke of York<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><em>‘Urm, we were hoping for Prince Harry to be honest with you, Mr Winsor.’</em> </span>.</p>

<p>Code Club offers <a href="https://training.codeclub.org.uk">online training</a> for volunteers which I have found very useful for knowing what to expect and making sure I have the prerequisite knowledge to add value to my local code club.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>

<p>The first two Code Club projects teach <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> - the programming equivalent of Lego. Scratch provides a brilliant introduction to coding, but sadly did not exist back when I first started teaching myself programming aged 8. My first introduction into the wonderful world of ones and zeros came courtesy of <em>SAMS Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 Hours</em>. It tooks me quite a bit longer than 24 hours and most of my programs were full of bugs, though admittedly that was mainly due to my inconsistent and questionable spelling! I got there, though, pursuing a passion to bring to life computer games of my own imagining<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">These were mainly themed around <em>Star Trek</em> - I was a hardcore geek (and proud) from a young age. </span>. You can read more about my experiences learning to code on the <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="my-passion">My Passion</h2>
<p>I grew up very privileged and was allowed a computer to play with at a very young age. Knowing that my father wouldn’t get upset if I did someone wrong and broke the computer fostered a curiosity about technology which quickly grew into confidence and passion.</p>

<p>I can remember trying to fix my class’s computer at school when I was about 7 years old and getting frustrated at an error message that made so little sense to me it appeared to be written in a different language. So I decided that I should learn computer programming to remedy this.</p>

<p>It was a while before I realised that computer science is a lot more than just programming (no amount of understanding Visual Basic code would have helped me decipher that error message), but by then I had the bug for programming<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Along with a plague of computer ‘bugs’ festering in my code! </span>.</p>

<p>Programming is about logic, yes, but to me it is also about creativity. I have never been able to paint nor draw, but I imagine that an artist receives a similar sort of satisfaction staring at their completed canvas as I do when my program finally executes without error. It’s that blending of creativity and logic that makes it exciting.</p>
